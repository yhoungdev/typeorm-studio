To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run both client and server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

- Client UI: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- Server API: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api`

- If you have port conflicts, run with custom ports:
  - `PORT=3001 CLIENT_PORT=5174 bun run dev`


NB: This is still a work in progress


This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.5. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
